# C# vs GO benchmarks
Same algoritms written in the most similar way possible in C# and GO for perfornamce comparison.

Each directory in the root should contain 'dotnet' and 'go' subdirectories as well as the python script that will run the benchmarks and write normalized output to a file.

The python script in the root directory runs all or selected benchmarks, gets the statistict and plots the charts.

## List of benchmarks

### 01-primes-naive
Prime numbers search. Naive approach.

### 02-primes-sieve-of-eratosthenes
Prime numbers search. Optimized approach.
